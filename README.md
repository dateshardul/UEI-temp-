## Our Prototype Website: A Primitive First Step

Our current prototype website, built rapidly using AI, is a **very early, primitive visual representation of the UEI dashboard.** It demonstrates the basic concept of a unified interface with navigation between the three core modules: **Recruit (SkillVerify AI), Onboard (OnboardPro), and Perform (PerformAI).**

**Key Features of the Prototype:**

*   **Basic Tabbed Navigation:**  Clickable tabs to switch between Recruit, Onboard, and Perform modules.
*   **Placeholder Content for Each Module:**  Simple headings and text to represent the dashboard areas for each module.
*   **Simulated "Create Job Posting" Functionality (Recruit Module):**  A button to toggle a form for creating a job posting (form is basic and non-functional).
*   **Simulated "View Candidate List" Functionality (Recruit Module):** A button to toggle a static placeholder list of candidates.
*   **Simulated "Welcome Dashboard & Tasks" (Onboard Module):**  Placeholder welcome message and a task list.
*   **Simulated "Access Training" Functionality (Onboard Module):** A button to toggle a placeholder training modules section.
*   **Simulated "Current Goals" Display (Perform Module):** Placeholder list of current goals.
*   **Simulated "Add New Goal" Functionality (Perform Module):** A button to toggle a form for adding a new goal (form is basic and non-functional).

**Limitations of the Prototype:**

*   **Not Fully Functional:**  The prototype is primarily visual. It **lacks real backend functionality**, database integration, AI capabilities, gamification, simulations, and actual data processing.
*   **Basic UI/UX:** The user interface is very basic and lacks advanced design elements, user-friendliness optimizations, and accessibility features.
*   **No Real Data:**  All data displayed (candidate lists, goals, training modules) is placeholder and static, not dynamically generated or connected to any system.
*   **Limited Interactivity:**  Interactivity is limited to basic tab switching and toggling form/section visibility. There are no complex user interactions or workflows implemented.
*   **No Mobile or USSD Version:** The prototype is designed for a desktop browser and does not yet consider mobile responsiveness or USSD interface requirements for rural accessibility.
